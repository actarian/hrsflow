							<div class="h4">Join us at Booth J81, Hall 5.2!</div>
							<p>At the upcoming trade show in Shanghai, live molding demonstrations will be held in cooperation with our project partners including materials suppliers, mold makers and injection molding machine manufacturers. Visitors will be able to experience FLEXflow and FLEXflow One technologies - the servo driven valve gate systems for 360° flow control and monitoring - and other innovative hot runner solutions for high demanding applications. At the ENGEL stand visitors will discover our innovative solutions for thick-walled lenses, while at the KraussMaffei booth, they will witness the production of an automotive radiator grille. At the Roctool booth a flat 50 %GF, PC laptop A-cover 14" will be produced in one shot. At Yizumi booth an automotive engine cover will be showed.</p>

							<div class="h4">LIVE DEMONSTRATIONS NOT TO BE MISSED</div>
							<div class="h5">At ENGEL booth (stand 5.1E71)</div>
							<p>Visitors will experience HRSflow Diamond Lux Line for thick-walled lenses. For the first time at Chinaplas, ENGEL will process LED lenses made of PMMA with a thickness of 22 mm for vehicle headlamps. This solution is suitable for any optical component not only in automotive lighting due to latest challenges in new car driving technologies.</p>
							<p>For both partners, ENGEL together with HRSflow, the main challenge is producing thick-walled lenses combining high optical quality with highly efficient production. Initially, a preform is produced and further layers of the same material added to it in subsequent stages. Overmolding compensates for any sink marks in the surface of the previous layer and achieves high optical quality.</p>
							<div class="h5">Krauss Maffei (Stand 2T01)</div>
							<p>Will showcase the production of an automotive front grille in a single shot created in cycle times of about 49 seconds. Formerly, by use of standard injection process you need multiple molds to produce A-surface parts with different shot weights and thickness. FLEXflow, on the other hand, is the optimal technology for family molds: it allows the filling of different volume cavities in one shot adjusting independently and accurately the flow rate into each cavity. The result is a premium quality part free of joint lines ready to be immediately painted and galvanized. HRSflow cascade system used during the live demo: 10 FLEXflow drops, servo driven valve gate. Molding material: SABIC PC-ABS CYCOLOY. Some samples will be available molded in PC LEXAN SLX 2271T in glossy piano black colour where no post-process is required.</p>
							<div class="h5">Visitors at Roctool booth (stand 2R01)</div>
							<p>Will be able to discover also our expertise in processing glass fiber reinforced materials. They will witness the production of a thin laptop A-Cover 14 ″ using a PC resin with high contents of glass fiber (up to 50%). The part, realized in partnership with Krauss Maffei and HRSflow electrically driven valve gate technology, combines both aesthetic and functional aspects. The result of this cooperation is an exciting surface effect produced in one shot: with 1.7 mm thickness, this application is characterized by the combination of a high gloss and a low gloss finishing. In addition, thanks to this solution, production scraps and cycle time and are considerably reduced, lower to 1 minute in order to match with the industry needs. The possibility to control pressures and flow rates at each individual gate, makes FLEXflow Technology the optimal solution not only for the production of automotive large format parts but also of small technical components realized with difficult material to process. HRSflow cascade system used during the live demo: 5 FLEXflow drops, servo driven valve gate.</p>
							<div class="h5">Yizumi booth (stand 4.1E61)</div>
							<p>Further examples of automotive applications obtained through our servo driven valve gate systems will be showcased also at Yizumi booth (stand 4.1E61). Visitors will experience the production of an automotive engine cover realized with FLEXflow One system: the electrically driven valve gate technology where an additional control unit is not required during the injection process. The engine cover is a lightweight under the hood application obtained thanks to the combination of HRSflow servo driven valve gate system and GK Concept (Germany) expertise that orchestrated in the perfect balance the physical foaming on back injection and In mould Graining Technology with a premium finish overmolding with aluminum foil. The part is characterized by a great dimensional stability. Moreover, FLEXflow One system ensures the maximum control of the melt flow and warpage.</p>

							<div class="h4">FLEXflow FAMILY: THE ELECTRICAL WORLD AT A GLANCE</div>
							<p>Simple, safe and clean. At the upcoming Chinaplas 2018, we will showcase our FLEXflow Family: the new range of product including the servo driven valve gate systems, FLEXflow and FLEXflow One technologies.</p>
							<p>Today’s automotive manufacturing environment is moving in a new direction: design complexity, e-car development, digitalization, autonomy driving and car sharing. Vehicles will become more and more lightweight, autonomous and connected. To face these new challenges and obtain the next-generation high quality parts, Tier1 and OEM customers will need increasingly flexible flow control.</p>
							<p>The electric servo technology by HRSflow is designed for the independent adjustment of each valve pin with precise control of stroke, velocity and force during opening and closing phases. This solution assures accurate, easy to operate, flexible control of pressures and flow rates at each individual gate during the injection process.</p>
							<p>To discover all the benefits of our servo driven valve gate technologies, the appointment will be at HRSflow’s Booth J81, Hall 5.2.</p>

							<div class="h4">HRSflow 360° KNOW HOW FOR EV AND AD VEHICLES: FROM THE SMALLEST TO THE LARGEST APPLICATIONS</div>
							<p>Behind each part, the best know-how. At the upcoming Chinaplas, we will illustrate our outstanding competency in hot runners for the most complex automotive parts designed for the EV and AD segments covering any single component of the vehicle where injection polymers are involved.</p>
							<p>Our innovative solutions meet the most stringent quality standards required by the future automotive industry in terms of performance, safety and lightweight. A significant example of our expertise will be represented by the latest challenging applications produced for the new NIO ES8: the cutting-edge 7-seater high-performance electric SUV.</p>
							<p>We look forward to meeting you!</p>
